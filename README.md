# Crystallography
Code for the study of mathematical crystallography. Developed at UNLV department of Physics.<br>
Note: This code has been transitioned into a new repository: 
https://github.com/qzhu2017/PyXtal<br>
## Current project: pseudosymmetry search (main.py)<br>
A program for calculating pseudymmetry groups for a given crystal structure.<br>
Wyckoff_Split(): returns the splitting and mapping of Wyckoff positions from a supergroup into a subgroup for a given Wyckoff letter.<br>
<br>
Current goals:<br>
*calculation of minimal supergroups for a given subgroup
*transforming general positions from one group setting to another via (W,w) transformation
