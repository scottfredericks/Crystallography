# Crystallography
Code for the study of mathematical crystallography. Developed at UNLV department of Physics.<br>
Note: code is constantly being updated and is not currently stable. If you wish to use the code, please notify me.<br>
## Current project: pseudo.py<br>
A program for calculating pseudymmetry groups for a given crystal structure. Current goals:<br>
*calculation of minimal supergroups for a given subgroup
*splitting of wyckoff positions from supergroup to subgroup
*transforming general positions from one group setting to another via (W,w) transformation
