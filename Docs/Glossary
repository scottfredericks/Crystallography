Glossary of Crystallographic Group Terms
----------------------------------------
Group: A set g with a binary operation on the set. The binary operation must have
	the following properties: closure, associativity, inverses, and an identity.
	So, we can think of the elements of the set as being operations themselves.
Subgroup: A subset of a group which still meets the criteria for a group.
	ex: the integers are a subgroup of the reals (for addition)
Supergroup: A group for which the given group is a subgroup.
	ex: the reals are a supergroup of the integers (for addition)
Normal Subgroup: a subgroup H of G which commutes with all g: (gH = Hg for all g)
Conjugate: two elements a and b (in some group G) are conjugate if a=gbg^-1 for
	some g in G.
Conjugacy Class: The conjugacy class of an element a is the set of all elements b
	which are conjugate to a.
Stabilizer:  
Normalizer:  
Lattice-Equal Subgroup: Subgroup U of G which contains G's translational group T:
	T is a subset of U
Class-Equal Subgroup: UT = G (U contains G's point group K, but not all of T)
