Glossary of Crystallographic Group Terms
----------------------------------------
Group: A set g with a binary operation on the set. The binary operation must have
	the following properties: closure, associativity, inverses, and an identity.
	So, we can think of the elements of the set as being operations themselves.
Subgroup: A subset of a group which still meets the criteria for a group.
	ex: the integers are a subgroup of the reals (for addition)
Supergroup: A group for which the given group is a subgroup.
	ex: the reals are a supergroup of the integers (for addition)
Normal Subgroup: a subgroup H of G which commutes with all g: (gH = Hg for all g)
Conjugate: two elements a and b (in some group G) are conjugate if a=gbg^-1 for
	some g in G.
Conjugacy Class: The conjugacy class of an element a is the set of all elements b
	which are conjugate to a.
Stabilizer: the set of group operations g which leave an element x invariant:
	gx = x
Normalizer: the set of group operations g which commute with a subset S:
	gS = Sg
Lattice-Equal Subgroup: Subgroup U of G which contains G's translational group T:
	T is a subset of U
Class-Equal Subgroup: UT = G (U contains G's point group K, but not all of T)
General Linear Group: GL(n,F) - group of invertible nxn matrices over the field F
Affine mapping: An affine mapping of R^n is of the form v -> gv + t, where g
	is in the general linear group GL(n,R), and t is in R^n.
	* the inverse of an affine transformation: (g|t)^-1 = (g^-1 | -(g^-1)t)
	*product of transformations: (g|t)*(h|s)=(gh|t+gs)
Affine Group: group consisting of the set of affine transformations
Orthogonal group: O(n) with elements g such that g transpose times g = I
	Includes proper rotations, but also improper rotations and reflections
	Handedness is generally not conserved. Determinant can be +-1 for f=R
Special Orthogonal group: SO(n), also called the rotation group - subgroup of
	O(n) which preserves handedness (only proper rotations)
Euclidean Group: a subgroup of the affine group where the matrix part is in O(n)
Space Group: a subgroup of the Euclidean group. Can be divided into T and K
Translation Group: T - the set of translations (1|t) of a space group G
	The set of translations forms a lattice
	T is normal in G
Point Group: K - the set of matrix transformations acting on the lattice
	K is a finite subgroup of O(n)
Nonprimitive Translation: a point not on the lattice, but which is contained in G
	via the point group
	These points corresponds to atom inside of a unit cell but not on the lattice
Symmorphic Space Group: contains a subgroup isomorphic to the full space group
Cocycle Condition:
